Thomas Cormen Algortihms--

I bet a quarter you always wondered what the heck an algorithm was, how do they look? Are they like in the movies? Crazy numbers that would let you decrypt the treasury department access passwords? haha.

Well, those were the questions i had when i started this journey 11 months ago and, by casualty of destiny, exactly back in April I heard about Thomas Cormen and his amazing newly updated Introduction to Algorithms bible. What a casualty, right?

IÂ´ve heard that the book was pretty good to understand algorithms in their pristine form, but also that it was a very technical book... and sure it was. The thing is that you don't need to be an actual mathematician that knows what will be the probabilty of landing a piece of paper into a trash can if you throw it 25 times to understand the algorithms that are explained in the book.

So, in the name of knowledge and my decision to take this seriously, I gave it a try, and that try ended up becoming a month and a half of coding all day & all night with the purpose of understanding the foundations of computation and give a logical improvement to my freshly coding mindset. This decision made it pay off. After reading that book i could understand a lot of stuff i had read and that i was reading everywhere.

Just to have a memory of that experience, I have uploaded the file where i had all the algorithms i wrote along with the pseudo code given by Thomas and his team.

<b> To finish, I just want to state that by no means i want to pretend that i remember the algorithms from memory and their pure functionality, because only practice gives you that power and that's something you get through time, so yeah. Also, in the near future, I'd like to share this compendium with students from different universities so they can have a friendly starting guide to Algos. </b>

-Peace
