Thomas Cormen Algortihms--

I bet quarter you always wondered what the heck was an algorithm, how do they looked? 
Are they like in the movies? crazy numbers that would let you decrypt the treasury department access passwords? haha.

Well, those were the questions i had when i started this journey 11 moths ago and by casualty of destiny, exactly back on april i heard about Thomas Cormen and his amazing newly updated Introduction to Algorithms bible. What a casualty right?   

IÂ´ve heard that the book was pretty good to understand algorithms in their pristine form but that it was a very technical book, and sure it was. The thing is that you dont need to be an actual matemathician that knows what will be the probabilty of landing a piece of paper into a trash can if you throw it 25 times to understand the algorithms that are explained in the book. 

So, in name of knowledge and my decicition to take this serious i gave a it a try that became a month and a half of coding all day & all night to understand the foundations of computation and give a logical improvement to my freshly coding mindset. This decision made its pay off, after reading  that book i could understand a lot of stuff i had read and that i was reading anywhere. 

Just to have a memory of that experience i have uploaded the file where i had all the algorithms i wrote along with the  pseudo code given by Thomas and its team. 

To finish i just want to state that  by no means i want to pretend that i remember from memory the algorithms and their pure functionality because only practice gives you that power and thats something you get through time, so yeah. Also in the near future I'd like to share this compendium with students from different universities so they can have a friendly start guide to algos.  

-Peace
